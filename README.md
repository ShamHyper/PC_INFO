### Collecting general information about the PC, displayed as a console

#### It is advisable to run as an administrator!

It works stably only on Windows OS and Nvidia GPUs ~~(AMD/Intel supported, but can work wrong!)~~ - __Now there is support for AMD/Intel video cards, but you will not be able to find out the frequency of the video core and memory__

The **PC_INFO** has additional functions: searching for information about the network, clearing the cache and temporary files and checking the integrity of the system using sfc

#### You must have python installed to work properly!
